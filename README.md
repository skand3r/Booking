# Booking Website Project (still in work)

This is a Spring project for a booking website where users can search for hotels, view available options, and manage their bookings. Currently, the focus is on hotel bookings, but the project is designed to be extendable to other types of bookings in the future (e.g., plane tickets, concerts, etc.).

## Features Implemented So Far

- **Spring JPA**: Connected to a PostgreSQL database.
- **Sign In and Sign Up Pages**: Basic user authentication with sessions managed using **Spring Security**.
- **PostgreSQL**: User and Hotel data are saved in a database.
- **Search for Hotels**: Users can search for hotels by city or view all available hotels.
- **Responsive UI**: clean, responsive layouts for webpages and booking interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Flexbox**.
## Technologies Used

- **Java** with Spring Boot: Core backend development.
- **Spring Framework**: For dependency injection, component management, and overall application structure.
- **REST APIs**: Implemented for operations like adding hotels to the database using **JSON**.
- **Spring JPA** For database interaction.
- **Spring Security** For user authentication and session management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing different data
- **HTML/CSS** Frontend design and styling, with clean, responsive layouts for webpages using **Flexbox**
- **Thymeleaf**: Used to dynamically render server-side data in the UI.
- **Lombok**: Simplifies code with annotations.

## Features Yet to Be Done

- Implement a booking system
- Create management sections for users to: view, update, cancel their bookings.
- Allow users to book specific room types in a hotel.
- Extend the project to support other types of bookings (e.g., plane tickets, concert tickets, etc.).
