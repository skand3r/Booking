# Booking Website Project (still in work)

This is a Spring project for a booking website where users can search for hotels, view available options, and manage their bookings. Currently, the focus is on hotel bookings, but the project is designed to be extendable to other types of bookings in the future (e.g., plane tickets, concerts, etc.).

## Features Implemented So Far

- **Spring JPA**: Connected to a PostgreSQL database.
- **Sign In and Sign Up Pages**: Basic user authentication with sessions managed using **Spring Security**.
- **PostgreSQL**: User and Hotel data are saved in a database.
- **Search for Hotels**: Users can search for hotels by city or view all available hotels.
- **Basic HTML/CSS Views**: Webpages are created using HTML and CSS (some external contributions).

## Features Yet to Be Done

- Add a booking system and a management section where users can view, update, or cancel their bookings.
- Create UI for the above functions.
- Allow users to book different types of rooms in a hotel.
- Extend the project to support other types of bookings (e.g., plane tickets, concert tickets, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Java** with Spring Boot
- **Spring JPA** for database interaction
- **Spring Security** for user authentication and session management
- **PostgreSQL** as the database
- **HTML/CSS** for frontend design
