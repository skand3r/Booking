# Booking Website Project (Under Development)

This is a Spring project for a booking website where users can search for hotels, view available options, and manage their bookings. Currently, the focus is on hotel bookings, but the project is designed to be extendable to other types of bookings in the future (e.g., plane tickets, concerts, etc.).

The implementation of this project can be seen on this website:
- [booking.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com](http://booking.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

## Technologies Used

- **Java** with Spring Boot: Core backend development.
- **Spring Framework**: For dependency injection, component management, and overall application structure.
- **REST APIs**: Implemented for operations like adding hotels to the database using **JSON**.
- **Spring JPA** For database interaction.
- **Spring Security** For user authentication and session management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing different data
- **HTML/CSS** Frontend design and styling, with clean, responsive layouts for webpages using **Flexbox**
- **Thymeleaf**: Used to dynamically render server-side data in the UI.
- **Lombok**: Simplifies code with annotations.

## Features Yet to Be Done

- Create management sections for users to: update, cancel their bookings.
- Allow users to book specific room types in a hotel.
- Implement ADMIN management for tracking and managing booking status.
- Extend the project to support other types of bookings (e.g., plane tickets, concert tickets, etc.).
